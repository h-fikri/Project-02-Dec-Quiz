## Task

Create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:

- A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.

  - Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  - When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  - If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

- The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

- When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score

## Challenges

- There are plenty of function chain reaction making the code debugging really painful.
- If there are one bug inside the function, it will break the whole code.
- I hope I can find more efficient way to debug the code.
